* **08-08-2022:**
  * The python library _geojson_ does not work properly. It does not load even when it is installed via conda or pip.
  * There is an update similar package called _geopandas_ (see [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/geopandas) for the package, and also [read the guide](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/io.html)).

* **10-08-2022:**
  * Had to import the _piexif_ library from conda.
